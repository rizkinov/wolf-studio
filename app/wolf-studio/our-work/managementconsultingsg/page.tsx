      "title": "Client-Centric Design",
      "description": "The front-of-house spaces were designed with client experience as the priority. A welcoming reception area transitions into versatile meeting spaces equipped with state-of-the-art presentation technology. Private client lounges provide discreet areas for sensitive discussions, while the showcase space highlights the firm's global achievements and methodology through interactive displays."

    {
      "title": "Collaborative Ecosystem",
      "description": "Beyond the client-facing areas, the workspace is organized into neighborhoods that support different work modes. Project zones feature flexible furniture systems that can be reconfigured based on team size and project requirements. Digital collaboration tools are integrated throughout, enabling seamless connection with global teams. Casual collision spaces encourage spontaneous interaction and knowledge sharing among consultants."

    {
      "title": "Wellness & Sustainability",
      "description": "Employee wellbeing was central to our approach, with biophilic elements incorporated throughout to reduce stress and improve cognitive function. The lighting design mimics natural daylight cycles, supporting healthy circadian rhythms despite long working hours. Sustainable materials with low environmental impact were selected, and energy-efficient systems were implemented to reduce the carbon footprint, aligning with the firm's global sustainability commitments."

    {
      "title": "Brand Expression",
      "description": "The firm's brand identity is subtly woven into the architectural elements and material palette. Corporate colors appear as thoughtful accents rather than overwhelming statements. Local art and design elements reflect Singapore's unique cultural position as a global business hub while creating a sense of place. The overall aesthetic strikes a perfect balance between timeless professionalism and contemporary innovation."
