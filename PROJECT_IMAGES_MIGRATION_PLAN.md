# Project Images and Content Management Migration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the migration from static file-based images to a full Supabase-powered image management system with rich text editing capabilities.

## 🎯 Goals
- Migrate all existing static images to Supabase Storage
- Replace URL-based image inputs with drag-and-drop file uploads
- Implement image cropping and standardization
- Add rich text editor for project descriptions
- Maintain exact visual consistency with existing project pages
- Auto-populate all existing hardcoded project content

## 📋 Implementation Plan

```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add storage-related columns
ALTER TABLE project_images ADD COLUMN storage_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE project_images ADD COLUMN file_size INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE project_images ADD COLUMN mime_type TEXT;
ALTER TABLE project_images ADD COLUMN crop_data JSONB;

-- Migration tracking
CREATE TABLE image_migration_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  original_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  new_storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  migrated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload** → Validate size/type → Temporary storage
2. **Crop** → User interaction → Generate cropped versions
3. **Optimize** → Compress/WebP conversion → Final storage
4. **Database** → Update records with new URLs

### Content Migration Strategy
```typescript
// Extract from existing project pages
const projectData = {
  // From existing files like /app/wolf-studio/our-work/myp/page.tsx
  title: "MYP",
  subtitle: "An SGX listed realestate investment company",
  description: [
    "WOLF was engaged by MYP...",
    "Inspired by a contoured design..."
  ],
  details: [
    { label: "Size", value: "5,000 sqft" },
    { label: "Location", value: "MYP Centre Level 9" }
  ],
  images: [
    { type: "banner", path: "/scraped-images/work-projects/myp/myp-banner.jpg" },
    { type: "gallery", path: "/scraped-images/work-projects/myp/myp-gallery-1.jpg" }
  ]
}
```
