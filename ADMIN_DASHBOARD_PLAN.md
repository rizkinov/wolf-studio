## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Categories**: Project organization and classification
- **Projects**: Core project data with JSONB descriptions
- **Project Images**: Gallery and banner image management
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for multi-user access

### Service Layer
- **ProjectService**: CRUD operations with filtering and pagination
